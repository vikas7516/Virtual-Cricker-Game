# Virtual Cricket App

**Author:** Vikas Lavaniya  
**Assignment:**  Final project of Internshala Trainings (C and C++ Course)

------


Project Overview:

The Virtual Cricket Game is a C++ project designed to simulate a cricket match between two teams. It showcases the use of object-oriented programming concepts like classes and objects, encapsulation, and inheritance. The project allows users to experience a simplified version of cricket gameplay in a virtual environment.



Learning Outcomes:

By working with this project, learners will:

Understand object-oriented programming principles.

Learn how to manage multiple files in C++ projects.

Gain insights into designing and implementing game logic.

Develop skills in compiling and running multi-file C++ programs.




Features:

Toss Simulation: Randomly determines which team bats first.

Gameplay Simulation: Handles batting, bowling, and scoring logic.

Score Tracking: Keeps track of individual player and team scores.

Result Declaration: Announces the winning team or a tie.




File Structure:

VirtualCricketGame.cpp: The main file where the game is executed.

game.cpp / game.h: Implements the core game logic.

player.cpp / player.h: Defines the Player class and manages individual statistics.

team.cpp / team.h: Defines the Team class and manages team operations.





How to Run the Project:

1. Set Up the Environment:

Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or MinGW) if not already installed.



2. Compile the Project: Open the terminal/command prompt and run:

g++ -o VirtualCricketGame VirtualCricketGame.cpp game.cpp player.cpp team.cpp


3. Run the Program: Execute the compiled file:

./VirtualCricketGame


4. Follow the On-Screen Instructions: The program will guide you through the game, including toss, batting, and results.





Key Concepts Covered:

Classes and Objects

Inheritance and Encapsulation

Multi-file Programming

Game Logic Implementation
